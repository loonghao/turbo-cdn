# Release-plz configuration for turbo-cdn (single package project)
#
# Strategy: release-plz handles crates.io publishing and creates GitHub releases,
# while .github/workflows/release.yml builds cross-platform binaries using upload-rust-binary-action.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. release-plz creates tag (v1.0.0) and GitHub release with changelog
# 2. Tag triggers release.yml workflow for cross-platform binary builds
# 3. upload-rust-binary-action builds and uploads binaries to the existing release
# 4. release-plz publishes to crates.io
#
# This approach leverages release-plz's strengths (version management, changelog, crates.io)
# while using the specialized upload-rust-binary-action for cross-platform builds.
